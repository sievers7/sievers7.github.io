									<h2><a href="#">The Florida Life <br />
									</a></h2>
									<p3>For this page, I'm going to stay away from going into too much detail on my childhood; one word sums it up: Florida. I'm really just going to talk about three specific stories from before I moved to Connecticut. </p3> 

								</header>
								<a href="#" class="image main"><img src="images/GROWING UPhome.webp" alt="" /></a>
                                <p>The house I grew up in has a multitude of memories, many I'm not going to be talking about, but quite a few are situations one can look at and describe as 'Florida'. I'm only going to be discussing three or four on this page. </p>
                                    <h3>My Neighbor's Dog</h3>
                                    <p> In the picture above, you see a roof; a particurally large roof. When I was younger I did a lot of archery, and in one instance, it was on that very roof. Now in the picture you can't see the towering tree that stood in my front yard, but when I was six it was very much there. One day, I had the seemingly brillant idea to aim for that tree . . . on my roof. At this particular time, my neighbor happened to be walking his dog. I of course, couldn't see them from my position on the roof. So I aimed for the tree, and missed. I hit the pavement less than a foot away from my neighbor's dog and from that point foward I stuck to archery on flat land.</p>
                                    <h3>New Years</h3>
                                    <p>In Florida New Years Eve is a filled with a lot of fireworks . . . like a lot. One particular New Years, my dad bought out an entire stand of fireworks so naturally we had all of our neighbors over to for a show. By the time it ended, they never came over for another New Years Eve. It started when one of the kids from next door proposed the idea of lighting a 250 round firework and putting it on my skateboard and pushing it down the street. So naturally. . . I did it. The first five rounds went off without a hitch, but on the sixth, it fell on it's side and started shooting towards the garage filled with people. My dad took a chance and kicked the firework and with pure luck, it landed straight up. However, not before blowing up a seat under a toddler. The kid was fine, but he most likely has a burning hatred for New Years Eve now. </p>
                                    <h3>Dad's Bestfriend</h3>
                                    <p>I wouldn't say I poisoned him. . . When I was younger I liked to make 'concoctions' and pass them off for the real thing. I did it quite often and usually it was just random things I found in my fridge. They were disgusting, but not harmful. . . most of the time. Then one time I decided to prank my dad's bestfriend. He really liked red gatorade, so I dyed my concoction to resemble it. I don't remember most of the ingredients, but the few I remember include: red wax (yes the kind from a candle), pickle juice, hot sauce, pool water, red food coloring, etc. I put it in an gatorade container and handed it off to him under the guise it was his favorite drink. Lets than a second after he put the drink to his lips he rushed out of the room. . . pretty sick. I was just a little kid and I didn't realize how harmful those drinks actually could have been, but in the end he got me back in a much more severe way.   </p>

                                    <h3>~Other~</h3>
                                    <p>These stories are just a fraction of the memories I have from Florida. I could go on and on about the time I crashed a motorcycle from my fence, or my crazy arson ideas in elementary school, or playing on the train tracks with my bestfriend, or when my house almost blew up. Or even some of the sweet ones, like how I would ride by bike every week to the local icecream shop, or go to the dog park with my dogs, or cooking with my mom. Whatever the case, Florida was an interesting 11 years and I haven't quite decided if I'm happy I moved up here or not.  </p>

										<h2><a href="#">Growing Up<br />

									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/florida.jpeg" /></a>
									<p>I was born in Bonita Springs, Florida on Febuary 15, 2007. For a while I enjoyed life in such a blissful state (or crazy, as I've now learned to recognize). In total, I spent the beginning 11 years in my first home on Jarvis Rd., until moving to Connecticut the summer before 6th grade. </p>

									<p>This page is subject to pending changes because it is simply a hypothetical idea of what I hope my future will look like. The Idea I have laid out in my mind mirrors the life my mom had. I want to get an MD in both Trauma Surgery and Holistic medicine, the logic behind this is quite simple and will be explained in much more depth on the full page</p>

									<p> There's a multitude of activities I enjoy in my spare time, but for the sake of this webpage I'll only be discussing three. One is Wrestling; something I started doing this year as a freshman at Taft and something I wish to continue throughout highschool. Another is Motocross; something I've been doing for a little less than a year now and that I am utterly fascinated by. The third is simply being with my friends and loved ones.  </p>

									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/Types-of-Art-848x530.jpeg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Despite not being listed under the Hobbies page, I would say that Art might be amongst my favorite hobby of all. Before coming to Taft, I took classes under Addie Capolla, who was an amazing artist that taught me everything I know. I would say I have somewhat of a high affinity for Art, and it's something I genuinly enjoy. This page will be showing some of my most favoritable pieces.</p>
