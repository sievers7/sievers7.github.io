								<a href="#" class="image main"><img src="images/IMG-2941.jpg" alt="" /></a>
								
                                These are two of the people closest to me: Muthoni and Molly. I spend pretty much every free moment I can with either of them and I just really enjoy being around them both. 
                                
                                <h3>Motocross</h3>
                                <a href="#" class="image main"><img src="images/HOBBIESmotocross.JPG" alt="" /></a>
                                My all time favorite activity during warm(ish) months is without a doubt Motocross. I haven't bee ndoing it for too long, but I love the adremeline rush and leaning curve that comes with it. My uncle started teaching me almost two years ago since he used ride A class. Although I'm nowhere near that level of skill, I enjoy every second on my dirtbike. The picture below is similar to the MX 508, which is a dirtbike track me and my uncle go to whenever we have free time while it's warm out. In addition to MX 508, we also go to MX 23 both of which are in Massachutes, but well worth the drive. If we ever want to just go for a calm senic ride through the woods we just head up to the Thomaston Dam, which is actually pretty close to Taft.

                                <h3>Wrestling</h3>
                                <a href="#" class="image main"><img src="images/HOBBIESwrestling.JPG" alt="" /></a>
                                I've done various styles of martial arts, starting when I was five, but this year I decided to try something different; I started wrestling at Taft. The season didn't go that great for me, but I had a lot of fun and learned a lot that I hope to take with me next year. I put it last on my hobbies simply because I haven't been doing it as long as my other hobbies, but it is certaintly somthing I with to continue.

									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/florida.jpeg" /></a>
									<p>I was born in Bonita Springs, Florida on Febuary 15, 2007. For a while I enjoyed life in such a blissful state (or crazy, as I've now learned to recognize). In total, I spent the beginning 11 years in my first home on Jarvis Rd., until moving to Connecticut the summer before 6th grade. </p>

									<p>This page is subject to pending changes because it is simply a hypothetical idea of what I hope my future will look like. The idea I have laid out in my mind mirrors the life my mom had. I want to get an MD in both Trauma Surgery and Holistic Medicine, the logic behind this is quite simple and will be explained in much more depth on the full page</p>

									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/hobbies.jpeg" alt=" alt=" /></a>
									<p> There's a multitude of activities I enjoy in my spare time, but for the sake of this webpage I'll only be discussing three. One is Wrestling; something I started doing this year as a freshman at Taft and something I wish to continue throughout highschool. Another is Motocross; something I've been doing for a little less than a year now and that I am utterly fascinated by. The third is simply being with my friends and loved ones.  </p>

									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/Types-of-Art-848x530.jpeg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Despite not being listed under the Hobbies page, I would say that Art might be amongst my favorite hobby of all. Before coming to Taft, I took classes under Addie Capolla, who was an amazing artist that taught me everything I know. I would say I have somewhat of a high affinity for Art, and it's something I genuinly enjoy. This page will be showing some of my most favoritable pieces.</p>

									<p>Out of all the subjects I'm taking this year, English is by far my favorite and I gennuinly enjoy writing. This is my most recent assignment on the story of Mr.Smith in the novel Things Fall Apart, and the role it plays in the overall novel. </p>
